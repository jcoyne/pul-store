**Note**: includes submodules. To get all of the required code, clone with:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:pulibrary/pul-store.git
```

You must establish a connection to github [using SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) rather than HTTPS for this to work.
